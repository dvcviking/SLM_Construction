# SLM_Construction
This open-source project aims to make a useful tool for people in the construction field. The tool will help them create synthetic data can that looks a lot like real construction information. This synthetic data can be used for small language model(SLM).


# Problem Statement 

As large language models scale, they can do many things but aren't experts in any one thing. Their abilities spread thin across different areas. Also, sharing private information with these models brings risks like security issues, breaking rules, and the possibility of data being leaked or misused.

These challenges encourage companies in various sectors to create their own compact, specialized language models using their internal data resources. Tailoring these models is more effective in meeting their specific accuracy and security requirements. We will showcase some prominent examples shortly.

# Solution
This open-source project aims to make a useful tool for people in the construction field. The tool will help them create synthetic data can that looks a lot like real construction information. This synthetic data can be used for small language model(SLM), such as building models, testing ideas, and checking if things work well. By making data that's similar to real construction situations, we want to improve how people do research, develop new things, and make decisions in the construction industry.
